# Build & Install

## Prerequisites

- Linux kernel 6.x+ with headers installed
- Surface Laptop 3 (AMD) or Surface Laptop 4 (AMD) — `AMDI0060` SPI
  controller with `MSHW0162` (SL3) or `MSHW0231` (SL4) touch controller
- `make`, `clang` or `gcc`, DKMS

## Unified Installer

All operations live in one tool: `tools/sl4a-touch.sh`
(subcommands: `install`, `uninstall`, `activate`, `status`, `logs`,
`rebuild`, `hunt`, `soak`).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/avgbob/SL4A_TouchScreen.git
cd SL4A_TouchScreen
sudo ./tools/sl4a-touch.sh install
sudo reboot
```

The installer:
1. Checks hardware (ACPI `MSHW0231`/`MSHW0162` + `AMDI0060`, DMI product)
2. Stages the driver source via DKMS (`/usr/src/sl4a-touch-<version>/`)
3. Builds and signs `sl4a-spi-amd.ko` + `sl4a-spi-hid.ko`
4. Writes the profile to `/etc/modprobe.d/sl4a-spi-hid.conf`
5. Installs `sl4a-touch-activate.service` (auto-activates after every boot)

### Uninstall

```bash
sudo ./tools/sl4a-touch.sh uninstall
sudo reboot
```

### Activate / status / logs

```bash
sudo ./tools/sl4a-touch.sh activate   # bind modules now (no reboot)
sudo ./tools/sl4a-touch.sh status     # hardware + runtime state
sudo ./tools/sl4a-touch.sh logs       # full diagnostic bundle, one text file
```

The bundle is written to
`sl4a-touch-diagnostics-<date>-<time>.txt` (or the path given with `-o`) and
holds everything a problem report needs on its own: OS and checkout revision,
ACPI/DMI identity, DKMS and modprobe state, the activation service, loaded
modules, every module parameter, the driver's sysfs stats (`build_info`,
`ready`, `lifecycle_status`, `seq_state`, `protocol_stats`, `baseline_status`,
error counters), the **last captured frame's cell field** (one byte per cell,
3456 bytes on MSHW0231 / 4056 on MSHW0162) as hex, and the
last 300 driver dmesg lines — which include the per-blob lines when
`sl4a_debug_level=2` is set.

## Secure Boot

If Secure Boot is enabled, the installer first resolves the **active DKMS
signing identity** from distro defaults plus
`/etc/dkms/framework.conf{,.d/*.conf}`. Ubuntu normally uses
`/var/lib/shim-signed/mok/MOK.priv` + `MOK.der`; upstream/Debian DKMS
normally uses `/var/lib/dkms/mok.key` + `mok.pub`. A valid matching pair is
reused by default. If no usable pair exists, the installer can generate or
import one, normalizes the certificate to DER, and prints the exact certificate
path to enroll with `mokutil`.

## Manual Build

```bash
cd driver
make LLVM=1 -C /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build M=$PWD modules
```

## Module Parameters

Profile parameters live in `/etc/modprobe.d/sl4a-spi-hid.conf`.
The standard profile is device-aware: MSHW0231 uses the Gate5 mode-1 bridge
while MSHW0162 keeps `raw_mode=N wire_double_opcode=1`.

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `raw_mode` | N | Enable raw heatmap + multi-touch mode |
| `sync_timeout_ms` | 6000 | Bounds every synchronous request (covers the ~3.6 s device settle) |
| `stream_watchdog_ms` | 2000 | Runtime streaming watchdog interval (0 disables) |
| `stream_watchdog_max_retries` | 3 | Re-init retries before giving up |
| `skip_getfeat` | 1 | Skip the connect-time GET_FEATURE exchange |
| `getfeat_delay_ms` | 0 | Delay between RPT_DESC and GET_FEATURE |
| `ema_alpha` | 2 | Position-smoothing EMA coefficient (position only) |
| `blob_max_distance` | 3 | Hungarian association base radius (cells) |
| `blob_min_weight` | 1000 | Minimum blob signal weight |
| `blob_debounce` | 3 | New-touch debounce frames |
| `blob_lift_frames` | 3 | Missed frames before lift |
| `hold_frames` | 0 | Hold grace period (0 = disabled) |
| `ghost_dist` | 6 | Post-association duplicate/coalescing radius in cells |
| `pre_assoc_ratio` | 0 | Pre-association weight filter (0 = disabled) |
| `grid_cols` | 0 (= per-device: 72 SL4 / 78 SL3) | Heatmap grid columns — per-device default by ACPI ID |
| `grid_rows` | 0 (= per-device: 48 SL4 / 52 SL3) | Heatmap grid rows — per-device default by ACPI ID |
| `calib_scale_x` | 0 | X scale ×1000 (0 = derived from the grid: 32767*1000/(cells-1)); override only for resolution/DPI needs |
| `calib_scale_y` | 0 | Y scale ×1000 (0 = derived from the grid: 32767*1000/(cells-1)); override only for resolution/DPI needs |
| `calib_offset_x` | 0 | X offset in screen pixels |
| `calib_offset_y` | 0 | Y offset in screen pixels |
| `invert_x` | 0 | Invert X axis |
| `invert_y` | 0 | Invert Y axis |
| `swap_xy` | 0 | Swap X and Y axes |

Device-specific defaults (set from the probe-selected config when the
parameter is left at 0):

| Device | ACPI ID | Grid | CapImg samples | Baseline frames | Baseline EMA alpha |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Surface Laptop 4 AMD | `MSHW0231` | 72×48 | 3456 | 30 | 7 |
| Surface Laptop 3 AMD | `MSHW0162` | 78×52 | 4056 | 33 | 7 |

The baseline recovery alpha (7) is the Windows-documented 12.5% recovery
rate; it is separate from the `ema_alpha` position-smoothing parameter.

## Verification

```bash
# Check driver loaded and bound
lsmod | grep sl4a
sudo ./tools/sl4a-touch.sh status

# Check touch device created
ls /sys/class/hidraw/
sudo evtest  # SL4: select "MSHW0231 Touchscreen" and verify MT events

# Watch the probe log for the per-device config line
sudo dmesg | grep -i "device config"
```

## Troubleshooting

### No touch after cold boot

A HID client's connect-time feature GET_REPORT can take up to ~3.6 s
while the device settles. Feature-query timeouts are **non-fatal**:
`sync_timeout_ms` (default 6000) bounds every synchronous request and a
timeout leaves the input stream untouched. If recovery is triggered,
dmesg shows an ACPI `_PS3`→`_PS0` cycle followed by RESET_RSP, DESCREQ,
discovery and state `DONE`.

### Secure Boot rejects the modules

Run `sudo ./tools/sl4a-touch.sh install --standard` again and use the
**DKMS MOK certificate path printed by the installer**. If that certificate is
not enrolled, stage exactly that path with `mokutil --import`, reboot through
MOK Manager, then verify with `./tools/sl4a-touch.sh status`. Do not assume
`/var/lib/dkms/mok.pub` on Ubuntu.

### No multi-touch, no contact

On MSHW0231 standard installs, verify the profile contains
`raw_input_beta=Y skip_std_getfeat=1 std_raw_transition=1`. The qualified
sequence writes GET6, waits 4.5-5.5 ms and sends SET5. On MSHW0162 the
standard profile remains single-touch; `--raw` is the explicit experimental
multitouch path.

### Slow touch or stuttering

- Reduce `ema_alpha` for more responsive movement (trade-off: more jitter)
- Increase `blob_lift_frames` if fingers are lost prematurely
- Check SPI bus speed with `cat /sys/module/sl4a_spi_amd/parameters/debug_trace`

### Touch not using full screen

Adjust `calib_scale_x/y` and `calib_offset_x/y`. With the default `0` the
driver derives the scale from the grid (`32767*1000/(cells-1)`), not from the
descriptor; override only for resolution/DPI needs.

## Known Issues

1. **Gate5 power lifecycle is SL4-qualified only**: the current MSHW0231 path uses `_PS3` on suspend and `_PS0` -> `_RST` on resume/cold activation. Do not generalize that qualification to MSHW0162.
2. **4+ finger instability**: Without the Mahalanobis contact classifier
   and per-cycle gain adaptation (both unavailable without device firmware
   access), tracking 4+ simultaneous fingers has partial contact loss.
3. **Raw transport is beta**: the explicit `--raw` profile is still an experimental path even though the MSHW0231 standard installer now uses CapImg through Gate5.
