# Config Table — Reference Values and Linux Mapping

Configuration values the Linux driver ports from the reference touch stack,
with adaptation where noted. Cross-reference: [Touch Pipeline](Pipeline).

## Association radii

Maximum distance a blob may move between frames, scaled by the number of
tracked fingers. Linux: `effective_radius = blob_max_distance × multiplier`.

| Reference value | Meaning |
|---:|---|
| 0.545009 | 2-finger radius multiplier |
| 1.218098 | Single-track continuity radius |
| 1.549246 | 3-finger radius multiplier |
| 1.845492 | 4-finger radius multiplier |
| 2.161228 | 5+-finger radius multiplier |

## Edge contact weights

Finger weight is reduced at panel edges (partial TX/RX coverage). Linux
multiplies first/last row/column cells before centroid computation:
`HEATMAP_EDGE_PENALTY_TOP = 97` (0.966512 × 100), `BOTTOM = 23` (0.228140 × 100).

| Reference value | Linux |
|---:|---|
| 0.966512 | top/side penalty ×0.97 |
| 0.228140 | bottom penalty ×0.23 |

## Coalescing threshold

| Reference value | Linux |
|---:|---|
| 36.0 | `ghost_dist = sqrt(36.0) = 6` cells |

## Pre-association filter

Rejects blobs below a fraction of the strongest blob's weight.

| Reference value | Meaning |
|---:|---|
| 0.611209 | Primary ratio threshold |
| 0.754732 | Secondary ratio threshold |

**Disabled in Linux** (`pre_assoc_ratio=0`): testing showed it is too
aggressive for multi-finger scenarios without the Mahalanobis classifier.

## Noise floor

| Reference value | Linux |
|---:|---|
| 0.04 | cells with c590 < 400 (0.04 × 10000) suppressed |

Applied during baseline processing, not after.

## Hold policy

| Reference value | Linux |
|---:|---|
| 0xB3 (enabled) | `hold_frames=0` — **disabled** |

The reference enables hold only for tracks passing strict quality checks
(duration ≤ 2 frames, pixel count in bounds, eigenratio < 4.0, signal > 0.095).
The initial Linux placeholder lacked these checks and caused scroll-brake
behavior, so hold is off by default.

## Touch detection threshold

| Reference value | Meaning |
|---:|---|
| 0.17 | Touch detection as a fraction of peak signal |

**Not standalone** — requires the per-cycle gain adaptation pipeline, which is
runtime-populated from device firmware. Cannot be used directly in Linux.

## Peak isolation gate

The detector qualifies each candidate against the raw byte plane (see
[Touch Pipeline](Pipeline)): it is **rejected when any of the four cells five
cells away on the cardinal axes reads below 135**. The threshold and the
distance are hard-coded in the detector, not read from the table.

| Encoding | Value |
|---|---:|
| raw byte (u8) | 135 |
| fixed point (u16) | 1000 (= 0.1 × 10⁴) |
| signal domain (float) | 0.1 |

A neighbour at or above 135 is *quiet* (`c590 ≤ 0.10025`, i.e. ≤ 1002 fixed
point); the test rejects the candidate when the deflection has not decayed
below that level within five cells. Samples that fall outside the raster
(x < 5, x + 5 ≥ columns, y < 5, y + 5 ≥ rows) **pass** — edge candidates are
never rejected by this gate.

## Peak acceptance and scoring kernel

Surviving candidates are scored with a **11 × 11 float kernel** (121 floats,
Σ = 1.5513; positive ring, negative corners, near-zero core):
`score = Σ kernel·c590` over the window, where columns outside the raster
contribute 0 and the window rows must fit inside the raster.

| Value | Meaning |
|---:|---|
| 0.04 | Peak acceptance in the alternate state |
| 0.05 | Peak acceptance, default |

Only the frame's highest-scoring candidate is published, and only when its
score reaches the threshold. The pipeline publishes **one peak per frame**;
multi-contact logic happens in the tracker that consumes it (see
[Multi-touch (Experimental)](Multi-touch-Experimental)).

## Published heat map

The reference stack publishes a decimated copy of the raster for the OS:

| Value | Effect |
|---:|---|
| 4 | Decimation factor `D`; rows and columns are divided by it (SL4: 12 × 18), shift = `log2(D)` = 2 |
| 1 | Enable flag (the decimated copy is skipped when zero) |
| derived | Cell values are divided by 10 before publication |

The destination is a 5616-byte buffer with a **72-byte row stride**, zeroed
before each write.

## Tracking constants

| Source | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---:|---|
| reference constant | 36.0 | Squared **handover radius**: a new frame peak within 6 cells of a track's prediction takes the track over; beyond that the track keeps its position |
| reference constant | 0.04 | **Per-track liveness**: a track that was not updated survives while its own cell reads `c590 ≥ 0.04` (400 fixed point), an absolute test — not a comparison with the strongest contact |
| coalescing constant | 36.0 | Coalescing / merge threshold (same value, see above) |

## Extended re-search (present, inactive)

The reference record carries a second-search family that widens the search
around the last published peak when a frame yields nothing:

| Value | Meaning |
|---:|---|
| 2 | Maximum candidate count that allows the re-search |
| 3 | Minimum consecutive empty frames before it arms |
| 5 | Maximum consecutive empty frames it tolerates |
| 0 | Enable flag — **0 in every device record**, so the path arms nothing |

## Runtime-populated values (unavailable)

Three regions are zero in the static reference image and populated at runtime
after gain calibration, so they are not portable without equivalent device
communication: per-cycle gain calibration data, the Mahalanobis classification
matrix (10×11 floats), and background noise tracking.

## Module parameters

Every Linux module parameter, its class and its load-time default. Defaults are
read from the driver source; the raw controls are load-time only, so every
profile is a fresh module load. The classes match the parameter contract in
`docs/PARAMETERS.md`.

## Per-device geometry

The reference values were taken from the SL4 (`MSHW0231`) pipeline. The SL3
AMD controller (`MSHW0162`) runs the same pipeline with a different sensor
grid selected by ACPI ID at probe: 78×52 (4056 CapImg samples) instead of
72×48 (3456), and a 33-frame resting baseline instead of 30. See
[Hardware](Hardware) and [Multi-touch (Experimental)](Multi-touch-Experimental).
