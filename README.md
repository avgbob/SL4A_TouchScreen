# SL4A TouchScreen

Linux kernel driver for the Microsoft Surface Laptop 3/4 (AMD) touchscreen,
implementing the MSHW0231 / MSHW0162 V0 HID-over-SPI transport and a
beta raw-heatmap multitouch pipeline on the AMD Cezanne FCH SPI controller.

## What to Expect

- The **standard installer profile** (default) provides **single-touch only** —
  basic tap, drag, and single-finger interaction.
- A **stylus/pen input node** is published by the HID descriptor but is
  **untested** — pen behavior has not been observed or validated.
- The beta heatmap multitouch pipeline can be reached either through the
  explicit raw profile (`raw_mode=Y`) or through the experimental
  standard-transport SET5 bridge (`raw_mode=N raw_input_beta=Y
  std_raw_transition=3`). The latter is a manually configured qualification
  profile, not an installer default or release-qualified profile.
- **Raw/heatmap multitouch remains beta** — targeted two-finger tracking is
  validated on the SL4 AMD test unit, while the broader hardware matrix remains
  incomplete.

See [`docs/QUICKSTART.md`](docs/QUICKSTART.md) for a 5-step install and
activation guide.

### Raw Touch Pipeline

The raw multitouch pipeline is an experimental implementation that processes
the current 72×48 fallback grid into HID contacts. Its comparison targets and
unresolved frame-layout assumptions are recorded in `docs/EVIDENCE.md`.

| Stage | Function |
|-------|----------|
| **c590 LUT** | Byte-indexed CapImg sample → fixed-point: `max(0, 10000 - ((i·22204 + 500)/1000 + 6000))` |
| **Baseline** | 30-frame asymmetric EMA per cell |
| **Noise floor** | c590 < 400 → suppressed (0.04 in the reference stack's fixed-point units) |
| **Peak gate** | Full radius-2 neighbourhood scan of touched cells, rise ≥200, max 20 peaks (equal-signal plateaus contribute one peak, anchored at the region's centre) |
| **CCL flood-fill** | 4-connected BFS, filters: n≥2, max_rise≥200, weight≥1000 |
| **Velocity rejection** | Blob must be within 6 cells of a detected peak |
| **Edge penalty** | Bottom edge ×0.23, other edges ×0.97 |
| **Blob splitting** | Multi-peak blobs (≥4 cells apart) split into sub-blobs |
| **Centroid** | Signal-weighted ×100 fixed-point on full blob extent |
| **Eigenvalues** | Second moments → touch major/minor/orientation |
| **Hungarian** | Associate the complete candidate set to persistent slots with multi-finger radii (1×2.2, 2×1.0, 3×2.8, 4×3.4, 5+×4.0) |
| **Post-association suppression** | Apply the strict ghost_dist=6 proximity rule only after assignment; candidates backed by two distinct established tracks are preserved |
| **EMA + deadband** | Alpha=2 smoothing, ±0.2 cell deadband, 2-frame stationary lock |
| **Lift lookback** | Emit lift at position from 2 frames ago |

## Install

Read [`docs/SUPPORT.md`](docs/SUPPORT.md) before installing. This repository is
only for the Surface Laptop 3/4 AMD `AMDI0060` + `MSHW0231`/`MSHW0162` hardware
contracts.
The installer stages the modules through DKMS and then **activates them right
away** (Step 7): it binds the experimental modules as soon as it finishes, and
enables a systemd unit that keeps them bound on every future boot. Have recovery
access ready (a local console or a remote shell) *before* running it. On Secure
Boot systems the MOK key must be enrolled first; until it is, activation is
skipped and the boot unit does it after the enrollment reboot.
Modules use distinct `sl4a-spi-amd` and `sl4a-spi-hid` names and never replace
in-tree drivers.
See [`docs/COMPATIBILITY.md`](docs/COMPATIBILITY.md) before treating a setup as
supported.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/avgbob/SL4A_TouchScreen.git
cd SL4A_TouchScreen
./tools/sl4a-touch.sh install --check
sudo ./tools/sl4a-touch.sh install
```

`install` prompts interactively for a profile (standard HID, the supported
default, or the experimental raw multitouch profile) unless `--standard` or
`--raw` is given explicitly. `--check` performs a read-only ACPI and
build-prerequisite preflight and needs no root; `--force` only to investigate
unsupported hardware.

`install` activates the driver before it returns (Step 7), so have
local/remote recovery access available *before* running it. Two cases skip that
activation, and the installer says so when they apply: with Secure Boot the MOK
key must be enrolled first (the boot unit activates after the enrollment reboot),
and when the selected profile changes the load-time `raw_mode` parameter the
modules keep the previous profile until the next boot, where the boot unit
activates the new one. The
experimental controller can also be activated by hand with:

```bash
sudo ./tools/sl4a-touch.sh activate
```

The command refuses to displace existing AMDI0060 or touchscreen
(MSHW0231/MSHW0162) drivers, then
verifies both bindings. To recover after a failed experiment, run
`sudo modprobe -r sl4a-spi-hid sl4a-spi-amd` and reboot. Use
`sudo ./tools/sl4a-touch.sh install --raw` only for the experimental raw
heatmap profile. `./tools/sl4a-touch.sh status` shows the installed version,
active profile, and whether the driver is currently loaded and bound;
`sudo ./tools/sl4a-touch.sh logs` collects a diagnostic bundle for bug reports.

The DKMS installer contains dependency guidance for Arch/CachyOS,
Ubuntu/Debian, Fedora, and openSUSE. Neither module exports aliases, so the
kernel never binds them on its own — the systemd unit `install` enables is what
repeats the binding after every boot. Secure Boot remains unqualified until recorded in the
compatibility matrix. See [`docs/ROLLBACK.md`](docs/ROLLBACK.md) for the
complete rollback and upgrade procedure.

## Module Parameters

```
/etc/modprobe.d/sl4a-spi-hid.conf:
  options sl4a_spi_hid raw_mode=N wire_double_opcode=1
```

The Gate-3 raw profile written by `sl4a-touch.sh install --raw` uses
`raw_mode=Y raw_input_beta=Y skip_getfeat=N raw_no_enable=1 gate3_observe_only=1 wire_double_opcode=1`, so its first hardware checkpoint follows the accepted Windows post-RDESC sequence without legacy retry traffic. The
targeted SL4 AMD tracker qualification instead used the manual
standard-transport beta bridge
`raw_mode=N raw_input_beta=Y skip_std_getfeat=1 std_raw_transition=3`;
the installer intentionally does not write that profile. Every raw/heatmap
control is experimental and load-time-only. The complete release, diagnostic,
and experimental contract is in [`docs/PARAMETERS.md`](docs/PARAMETERS.md).

## What Will Not Work

- **Multi-touch in the standard installer profile** — it forwards standard HID
  reports and does not enable the heatmap bridge. An experimental manual
  standard-transport SET5 bridge exists, but it is not a release/default
  profile.
- **Pen input** — the raw input device publishes touch contacts only and the
  driver contains no pen-specific handling, so pen behavior is unvalidated.
- **Palm rejection** — no palm/rejection stage exists in the pipeline.
- **Other Surface models** — the ACPI match tables accept only `MSHW0231` /
  `MSHW0162` (touch) and `AMDI0060` (SPI controller).

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| No touch after cold boot | Power off → unplug AC → wait 30s → reboot |
| No touch after cold boot, but the driver looks ready (dmesg shows the descriptor, HID registered, `ready`) | Set `std_liveness_ms=8000` (`echo 'options sl4a_spi_hid std_liveness_ms=8000' \| sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/sl4a-liveness.conf`), cold boot, then read the `standard-mode liveness` line in dmesg: it reports the controller activity (IRQs) seen in that window, so a healthy idle device prints the alarm too (upstream issue #4) |
| No touch after cold boot and no `RESET_RSP` in dmesg at all | Enable the backstop: `echo 'options sl4a_spi_hid wait_reset_kick_ms=4000' \| sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/sl4a-kick.conf`, then cold boot. dmesg then shows `no RESET_RSP and no IRQ at all after 4000 ms, forcing DESCREQ`, and the descriptor poller keeps reading until the device answers. A `DESCREQ write to a silent controller failed 3 times` line instead means the SPI write itself is failing (bus level), not that the device stayed quiet. If the touchscreen never comes back, power off, unplug AC, wait 30 s, reboot and report the log in upstream issue #4 |
| No multi-touch (only single-touch) | The standard installer profile is single-touch. Use the explicit experimental raw profile, or consult `docs/STANDARD-SET5-MULTITOUCH.md` for the manual standard-transport beta bridge used in targeted qualification. |
| Fingers lost during fast movement | Increase `blob_lift_frames` |
| Jitter during pinch-to-zoom | Verify `ema_alpha=2`, stationary lock active |
| Module rejected (Secure Boot) | Enroll DKMS signing key via distribution MOK |

## Build from Source

For development without DKMS (modules built this way are unsigned — turn Secure
Boot off, or sign them yourself):

```bash
make -C /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build M=$PWD/driver modules
sudo cp driver/sl4a-spi-amd.ko driver/sl4a-spi-hid.ko /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/updates/dkms/
sudo depmod -a
sudo ./tools/sl4a-touch.sh activate
```

The modules export no aliases, so the kernel never loads them on its own: after
a reboot run `activate` again, or use `install`, which also sets up the boot
unit that repeats the binding automatically.
