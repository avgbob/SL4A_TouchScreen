"""Structural sanity for the driver sources.

driver/spi-hid-core.c cannot be compiled on this host (no kernel headers), so
the kernel build in CI is the only *compile* gate and it runs minutes later, on
another machine. Two edits in this campaign were shipped broken because of
exactly that gap (a naive function deletion that cut a doc comment in half, and
a comment that swallowed the following declaration). This test is the cheap
local gate: it does not need headers because it only looks at structure.

Checks, per file: every /* has a */, and braces/parens/brackets balance outside
comments and string literals. A file that fails here cannot compile, whatever
the kernel headers would have said.

# a block the compiler drops. A directive is refused (and its block
# dropped from the code view) only when its condition is PROVABLY false
# for this tree: every symbol it tests has no `#define` in any driver

# kept too — the ladder refuses only what it can prove, and the
