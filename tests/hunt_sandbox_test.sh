# a two-line comment whose second line had lost its leading '#', which bash
# then ran as a command ('yields: command not found'), killing hunt with rc=127
# after it had already unloaded the driver. bash -n cannot see that, the host
# suite could not see that, and the artifact looked complete because stderr
# from inside the sweep is redirected into the file.
#
# So: build a fake machine (stub modprobe/dkms/dmesg/sleep, a fake panel in a
# fake sysfs, a fake input event node + evdev char device, a profile file),
# point the tool at it, run `hunt`, and demand the things a working battery
# must produce. Only the root check and the absolute paths are patched out of
# the copy under test; everything else is the shipped script, verbatim.
