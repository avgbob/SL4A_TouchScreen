# sl4a-touch.sh — unified install / uninstall / activate / status / logs /
# rebuild tool for the SL4A_TouchScreen driver (Surface Laptop 3/4 AMD
# touchscreen, MSHW0231 / MSHW0162 over AMDI0060).
#
# Replaces the previously separate tools/install.sh, tools/uninstall.sh,
# tools/activate-fch.sh, and tools/rebuild_and_install.sh with one entry
# point. Tested on: Arch, CachyOS, Ubuntu/Debian, Fedora, openSUSE.
#
# Usage:
#   ./tools/sl4a-touch.sh                              interactive arrow-key menu
#   sudo ./tools/sl4a-touch.sh install [--standard|--raw] [--check|--dry-run] [--force] [--rotate-mok]
#   sudo ./tools/sl4a-touch.sh uninstall
#   sudo ./tools/sl4a-touch.sh activate
#   ./tools/sl4a-touch.sh status
#   sudo ./tools/sl4a-touch.sh logs [-o FILE]
#   ./tools/sl4a-touch.sh rebuild            (developer use only, see --help)
#
# install builds, installs via DKMS, enables a systemd unit that
# auto-activates on every future boot (after multi-user.target — i.e.
# after the base system, not during early kernel boot), and activates
# immediately. Nothing here requires typing a subcommand: run the script
# with no arguments for an arrow-key menu. Run with -h/--help for the
# full command list.

sl4a-touch.sh — SL4A_TouchScreen driver management tool

Usage: tools/sl4a-touch.sh <command> [options]

Commands:
  install [--standard|--raw] [--check|--dry-run] [--force] [--rotate-mok]
                    Build, install via DKMS, enable automatic activation on
                    every future boot (a systemd unit gated on
                    multi-user.target — after the base system is up, not
                    during early kernel boot), and activate immediately.
                    Nothing further to run. Prompts interactively for a
                    profile if none is given on a terminal; defaults to
                    --standard otherwise.
                      --standard  Single-touch + pen. Stable, supported. (default)
                      --raw       Beta heatmap multitouch. May be
                                  unstable; no hardware-qualified result yet.
                      --check     Validate prerequisites only, write nothing.
                      --dry-run   Validate and print the selected profile.
                      --force     Continue even if expected hardware/DMI is
                                  not detected.
                      --repair    If a file at one of the tool's own paths
                                  (the modprobe conf, the boot unit) is not
                                  ours, move it aside to <path>.unowned-<time>
                                  and continue. Nothing is deleted; without
                                  this, install and uninstall both refuse and
                                  the machine is stuck until you move the file
                                  yourself.
                      --rotate-mok Secure Boot only: deliberately generate a
                                  new DKMS signing key pair even when a valid
                                  pair already exists. Existing MOK material
                                  is backed up under /var/lib/dkms before it
                                  is replaced; enroll the new certificate on
                                  the next reboot.

  uninstall [--repair]
                    Remove the installed driver, its DKMS registration, and
                    the boot-activation service. Loaded modules are left
                    running until reboot.
                      --repair    Move aside (never delete) a file at one of the
                                  tool's own paths that is not ours, instead of
                                  leaving it in place to block install.

  activate          Load and bind the modules right now. install already
                    sets this up to happen automatically on every future
                    boot; use this command directly only to redo it
                    immediately (e.g. after 'rebuild', or to retry after
                    fixing a Secure Boot key enrollment). Refuses to
                    displace a device already bound to another driver.

  status            Show the installed DKMS version (if any), whether it
                    matches this checkout, the active profile, and whether
                    the driver is currently loaded and bound.

  logs [-o FILE]    Collect a diagnostic bundle (versions, dkms/modprobe
                    state, driver sysfs stats, the last captured frame as raw
                    bytes, filtered dmesg) into a single text file for bug
                    reports. Default output path is printed at the end.
  hunt [-o PATH]   One command for a display problem: runs the full battery —
                    every field variant the campaign designed (11 raw + 4
                    standard), one per driver reload, on the command line so
                    /etc/modprobe.d is never edited. For each it unloads and
                    reloads the driver at debug level 3, waits while you touch
                    the panel (reading the touch device's evdev node, or a
                    y/n fallback), snapshots the counters before and after,
                    and records the driver log. Writes ONE file with every
                    variant's profile, counters, deltas, log, a verdict line
                    and a final summary table. Send that file.
                    Default output: next to the driver, like the
                    diagnostics bundle (sl4a-hunt-<timestamp>.txt).
   soak --minutes N [-o FILE] [--profile raw|standard|current] [--interactive]
                     Observe the RUNNING driver for N minutes WITHOUT
                     unloading, reloading, or asking anything: every 30 s it
                     snapshots ready, seq_state and protocol_stats, slices
                     the kernel log for the interval, and watches the touch
                     evdev node in the background (no prompts — 'evdev
                     unavailable' is recorded when there is no node). The
                     pinch phase is skipped unless --interactive is given on
                     a terminal. Writes ONE file with per-interval deltas, a
                     VERDICT line (PASS only when ready and seq_state 4 hold
                     steady and either touch data flows with zero drops or
                     the IRQ line stays flat with no storm) and a summary
                     table. Run with sudo so the dmesg slices are populated;
                     without root the counters still work.
                     Default output: next to the driver, like the
                     hunt battery (sl4a-soak-<timestamp>.txt).


  rebuild           Developer use only: rebuild the .ko files against the
                    running kernel and drop them directly into
                    /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/updates/dkms/, bypassing DKMS.
                    Use this while iterating on driver source; use "install"
                    for anything you want to survive a kernel update.

  -h, --help        Show this help.

# ── frame-hunt battery plan ─────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# One line per variant: `<profile>|<label>|<params>`. The profile selects the
# base parameter set (hunt_profile_params); the params are the extra module
# parameters appended to that variant's load line. The whole flow — unload,
# load, settle, snapshot, touch (evdev read + verdict), counter deltas, dmesg
# slice, artifact block, summary row — is driven from this array, so a new
# variant is a one-line addition and nothing else changes.
#
# RAW is today's Gate-3 raw profile (raw_mode=Y raw_input_beta=Y skip_getfeat=N raw_no_enable=1 gate3_observe_only=1);
# STANDARD is the single-touch path (raw_mode=N). The retired pc/svs arms
# (acpi_probe_power_cycle × skip_vendor_stop, the P13-P16 waves) are NOT
# re-run: that question is answered (all four arms negative), and running it
# twice wastes a field trip. Revive it by adding a line here.
#
# The three `wire_double_opcode=1` combinations after its first row are the
# 2026-09-17 battery's one positive: raw wire_double_opcode=1 was the only
# variant that delivered a descriptor, so its read-side partners
# (read_frame_variant=2, raw_pre_desc_reg0=1, both) are the shapes that have
# never been run. Kept next to the row they extend, not appended at the end.
#
# raw raw_b1f8109_preset=1 sits right after the doubled-write row it gener-
# alises: the preset is the whole b1f8109 raw dialect behind one switch
# (doubled writes PLUS the pre-DONE reg0 reads, the poller give-up and the
# D2/D0-without-STOP teardown). It is the "restart from where it worked"
# candidate, so the operator reads it directly under the doubled-write row it
# extends rather than appended at the end.
