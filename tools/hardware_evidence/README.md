# Hardware Evidence Collection

`collect.sh` is a read-only evidence harness for the Surface Laptop 4 AMD
touchscreen (`AMDI0060` and `MSHW0231`). It discovers ACPI, SPI, input, and
module sysfs nodes at collection time rather than relying on assigned device
paths. It does not install, load, unload, bind, configure, or otherwise alter
drivers or hardware.

`capture_direct_touch.sh` records a bounded `evtest` trace for the standard HID
direct-touch device. It identifies the HID-core node from `045E:0C19` ancestry
and direct-touch/absolute/touch capabilities; it never assumes an `eventN`
number.

`capture_beta_multitouch.sh` records the driver-owned heatmap multitouch bridge.
It requires the exact `MSHW0231 Touchscreen` input name plus multitouch
tracking capability (`ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID`), so a qualification run cannot
silently capture the standard HID node instead of the beta bridge.

`capture_stylus.sh` records a bounded `evtest` trace for the standard HID
stylus. It requires HID `045E:0C19` ancestry, an input name containing `Stylus`,
absolute X/Y, and pen-tool capability; it never assumes an `eventN` number.

`capture_linux_trace_bundle.sh` is the Phase 4 session collector. It provides a
bounded Linux counterpart to the Windows transaction evidence: a UTC-bounded
session window, host provenance, dynamically discovered ACPI/SPI/input state,
and a timestamped journal slice filtered to SL4A/SPI/HID/touch lines. Direct
 touch and stylus `evtest` captures are opt-in.

`run_blinded_session.sh` is the operator-facing wrapper for one opaque blinded
period and case. It calls the existing read-only collector and trace bundle
helpers, writes a worksheet and role-boundary instructions, and generates a
SHA-256 checksum list. It neither accepts nor reveals profile information.

## Usage

Run from the repository root. No privilege escalation is performed or needed
for the normal collection:

```sh
./tools/hardware_evidence/collect.sh
./tools/hardware_evidence/collect.sh --output /tmp/sl4a-evidence
./tools/hardware_evidence/capture_direct_touch.sh --duration 20 \
  --output evidence/run-1/p1-one-touch.evtest.txt
./tools/hardware_evidence/capture_beta_multitouch.sh --duration 20 \
  --output evidence/run-1/p1-beta-multitouch.evtest.txt
./tools/hardware_evidence/capture_stylus.sh --duration 20 \
  --output evidence/run-1/p1-pen.evtest.txt
./tools/hardware_evidence/capture_linux_trace_bundle.sh --duration 20 \
  --capture-direct-touch --capture-beta-multitouch --capture-stylus \
  --output evidence/run-1/p1-input-session
./tools/hardware_evidence/run_blinded_session.sh --period p1 --case one-touch \
  --duration 20 --capture-direct-touch --capture-beta-multitouch --capture-stylus \
  --output evidence/run-1/p1-one-touch
```

The blinded-session output directory must be new. Its `collection/` and
`trace/` subdirectories retain helper artifacts, while `operator/worksheet.txt`,
`session-status.txt`, `ROLE_BOUNDARIES.md`, and `checksums.txt` support the
operator and assessor workflow. The period label is restricted to `p1`, `p2`,
or `p3`; case names are opaque identifiers. No profile names or mappings belong
in the command or output tree.

The output directory must not already exist. It is created with owner-only
permissions. If kernel log access is restricted, the `dmesg` artifact records
the resulting error. Run the collector with access to privileged kernel logs
only when that log evidence is required; the collector itself never invokes
`sudo`.

The capture output must be a new file in an existing directory. It contains
the selected sysfs identity and capabilities followed by raw `evtest` output.
`evtest` is used only when already installed; the helper neither installs it
nor changes drivers. The caller may need existing permission to read
`/dev/input/eventN`; no privilege escalation is attempted. If a requested
input capture fails, the trace bundle now exits non-zero so the parent session
records `trace-failed` rather than reporting a misleading completed session.

The trace bundle directory must also be new. Its duration is limited to 1-3600
seconds and defaults to 20. `journalctl` and `/dev/input` can require privilege;
the caller may run this helper under `sudo`, but the helper never invokes it.
Restricted journal access is retained in `kernel/journal-sl4a-session.txt`.

## Artifact Layout

```text
sl4a-hardware-evidence-<UTC timestamp>/
  manifest.txt                     collection identity and artifact list
  provenance/                      kernel, OS, command line, DMI, Secure Boot
  modules/                         DKMS status, modinfo, loaded modules, parameters
  sysfs/                           discovered ACPI and SPI nodes and state attributes
  input/                           discovered input nodes and libinput/evtest availability
  kernel/dmesg-last-300.txt        bounded recent kernel-log slice
```

The Phase 4 bundle has this session-oriented layout:

```text
sl4a-linux-trace-<UTC timestamp>/
  manifest.txt                     format, UTC bounds, options, SHA-256 artifacts
  provenance/                      host, OS, kernel command line, matched modules, DMI
  sysfs/                           dynamically discovered ACPI and relevant SPI state
  input/                           dynamically discovered SL4A HID candidates and evtest trace
  kernel/journal-sl4a-session.txt  filtered, timestamped, line-capped journal window
```

`manifest.txt` is line-oriented: its header identifies format version, UTC
session bounds, requested options and direct-touch result, collector identity,
and safety contract. The
`artifacts_sha256` section lists SHA-256 and relative path for every artifact
except the manifest itself (a file cannot contain a stable checksum of itself).

The SPI evidence includes driver-exposed state attributes when present:
`ready`, `protocol_stats`, `baseline_status`, and `lifecycle_status`. Missing
or unreadable paths are recorded as evidence, not treated as collector errors.
