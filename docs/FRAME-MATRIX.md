# Frame matrix — every frame this driver sends, against its source

Written after a frame audit that compared three independent things: the frames
this driver builds (`driver/spi-hid-wire-frames.h`), the frames in the reference
captures (`traces/*.csv`, via `tools/parse_spi.py`), and the frames the Windows
minidriver constructs (`hidspi` V0, decompiled under `~/sl4a-analysis/decomp`).

The rule the audit enforces: **every frame must name its source.** A frame with
no source is a guess wearing a constant's clothes.

## Handshake reads

| frame | bytes | source |
|---|---|---|
| read, reference shape | `0B 00 00 00 FF 00 00 <reg> 00` (9B) | the reference's own boot reads: register 0 for its reset and drain, register 3 for the descriptor's responses |
| read, legacy shape | `0B <reg3> FF` (5B) | the field only — kept because this panel answers it; the sweep keeps testing it |
| read, **stream** | `0B 00 00 00 FF 00 03 0A 00 56` (9B) | the reference's DATA reads: offset 7 = **0x0A**, dozens of them once the stream is up (TXN#869+). A first version of this table listed only registers 0 and 3 — a leg caught the omission, the same one that drove the wrong register change, because the stream is read through the same helper. |

The three registers, per phase, are the whole story: **0** while the driver is in WAIT_RESET (the reset and its drain), the descriptor register (**3** on this device) through the descriptor phases, and the stream register (**0x0A**) once the sequencer is DONE.

The register these go to was wrong for the whole campaign and was fixed last:
in raw mode the sequencer reads **register 0**, unconditionally, because that is
where the reference reads its reset and its drain. Two earlier attempts (a flag,
then a state gate) were each falsified by one field run. The decisive evidence
had been in the log all along: a WAIT_DESC read on the stream register answered
`01 ff ee ff ff ff ff ff 32` — a frame **three bytes behind a native prefix**,
its sync (`5A`) three bytes past the end of that nine-byte read. (This paragraph
said "nine bytes out of position" until a cross-family leg proved it wrong with
a harness over this very source: there is no shift, and the bytes behind the
prefix are the reference's own frame — header at offset 8, sync at 11.)

## Descriptor handshake writes

| frame | bytes | source |
|---|---|---|
| DESCREQ, device descriptor | `02 00 00 01 42 00 00 03 00 00` | trace, byte for byte (`surface_boot_auto.csv`, and V0's `ConfiguringDescriptorTransferEntry` builds `02 <reg> 42 00 00 03 00 00` at length 10) |
| DESCREQ, report descriptor | `02 00 00 02 42 00 00 03 00 00` | trace, byte for byte |

Both are the trace's exactly. This is the one part of the protocol that was
never in doubt after the parser learned to print bytes.

## Feature commands

The rows below distinguish **capture fixtures** from semantic fields. Gate 2
showed that bytes outside a short content payload can vary, so matching one old
14-byte buffer does not make its padding a protocol constant.

| frame | observed bytes | source / status |
|---|---|---|
| GET_FEATURE 6 | `02 00 00 03 42 00 04 03 00 06` (10B) | older capture and Gate-2 T2 agree byte-for-byte |
| SET_FEATURE ID5=1 | old: `02 00 00 03 82 00 03 04 00 05 01 0C EE 5B`; Gate-2 T2: `... 05 01 D7 FC 6E`; resume also showed `...05 01 00 00 00` and `...05 01 A1 01 00` | semantic payload is only the one byte `01`; the last three bytes are alignment/padding, not a universal key |
| SET_FEATURE 0x56 enable | older: `02 00 00 03 C2 00 03 0A 00 56 BD 0C EE 5B 44 4C 00 00`; Gate 2: `02 00 00 03 C2 00 03 0A 00 56 D9 D7 FC 6E 79 4C 00 00` | the six bytes after `56` are semantic payload and vary between captures; generation/source is **UNKNOWN** |
| SET_FEATURE 0x56 stop | `02 00 00 03 C2 00 03 0A 00 56 FF FF FF FF FF FF 00 00` | observed before Gate-2 sleep, followed later by `_PS3` |

Gate-2 T2 order was RDESC -> 0x56 -> GET6/reply -> ID5. Gate-2 resume did
**not** replay that sequence: no RDESC or GET6 was observed after resume.

## Power frames

| frame | observed bytes | source / status |
|---|---|---|
| SET_POWER D0 | older capture: `... 01 0C EE 5B`; Gate-2 T2 before disable: `02 00 00 04 82 00 00 04 00 01 01 D7 FC 6E` | selector/payload byte `01` is stable across those observations; the final three bytes are not established as semantic |
| SET_POWER D2 | older documentation inferred a twin with selector `02` | **not observed** in Gate 2; exact Gate-2 search found no D2 twin |

Gate 2 now includes an actual sleep/resume lifecycle. It observed an all-FF
0x56 stop before sleep, then `_PS3`; resume used `_PS0 -> _RST`. No wire-level
D2 command was found in the captured Gate-2 windows. Therefore the legacy
Linux D2->D0 "vendor init" remains a historical/recovery experiment, not a
Gate-2-derived Windows lifecycle rule.

## The honest limit of every register claim here

The reference's registers live at **offset 7 of a nine-byte read** — the shape
Windows sends. The dialect this panel accepts is the **five-byte read, register
in the address field** — measured, repeatedly, and the reason the legacy variant
exists. **Mapping one onto the other is an interpretation, not a measurement**:
under the panel's own decoding, the reference's "register 3" reads carry zero in
the address field and would look like register-0 reads. So the register table
above is what the trace says Windows asked for, translated into the dialect this
panel answers — and the field is what decides whether the translation is right.

Two independent legs checked this boundary and one of them went further, calling
offset 6 the register. It is not: the parser's own labels are `a7` for offset 6
and `a8` for offset 7, and the feature response reads (`0B 00 00 00 FF 00 04 03
00`, TXN#221) carry **content type 4** at offset 6 and **register 3** at offset
7 — the same register as the descriptor. The distinction matters because the
wrong reading would have sent the feature path to a register that does not
exist in this protocol.

One difference remains and is **not expressible in the winning dialect**: the
reference marks feature-response reads with content type 4, while the five-byte
form this panel answers has no content-type field at all. Recorded here rather
than patched, because the form that could carry it is the form the panel ignores.

## What is not in this driver, and should not be

The traces carry whole families this driver never sends: `0x24` (calibration),
`0x25` (the touch reports — ascending address pairs), `0x26` (the firmware
upload, in 20-byte chunks), `0x28`/`0x29`, `0x84`. They belong to the Windows
driver's own stream and firmware paths. The raw path this driver implements is a
different mode; those frames are recorded here as *known and intentional*
absences, not as gaps.

## The two lessons of this audit

1. **An inventory that is empty for a whole category is a broken inventory.**
   The audit's first pass "proved" the traces contain no power frames — because
   the extraction script had dropped every `0x02`-family frame. The empty
   category was the signal, and I read past it. The frames were there, cited by
   transaction id, in the test file.
2. **A derivation is not a source.** An earlier assertion demanded the power
   trailer *because the enable key contains the same field* — an analogy. It
   turned out to be right, but for a reason nobody had written down; the audit
   only established that when it found the ETW transaction number. Write the
   source, not the reasoning.
