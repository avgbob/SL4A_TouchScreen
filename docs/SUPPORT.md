# Supported Hardware And Profiles

## Supported Target

This repository is a DKMS driver for the Surface Laptop 3/4 AMD touch
contracts (MSHW0231 on SL4, MSHW0162 on SL3):

| Component | Required identity | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Product | Microsoft Surface Laptop 4 AMD (Cezanne) / Surface Laptop 3 AMD | E1 required for a release row |
| SPI controller | ACPI `AMDI0060`, MMIO `0xFEC10000`, length `0x100` | `docs/acpi/dsdt.dsl` |
| Touch controller (SL4) | Runtime ACPI `MSHW0231` under `\_SB.SPI1` | Windows capture and target-machine check |
| Touch controller (SL3) | Runtime ACPI `MSHW0162` under `\_SB.SPI1` | Upstream issue #6 report (guskog, real SL3) |
| SPI resource | Logical CS 0, mode 0, 33.33 MHz, GPIO 0x55 | `docs/acpi/dsdt.dsl` |
| HID descriptor | Microsoft VID `045e`, PID `0c19` | captured report descriptor |
| Transport | MSHW0231 / MSHW0162 HID-over-SPI V0 | captured protocol traffic |

The controller programs physical ALT_CS 1 for this board even though ACPI
declares logical CS 0. This mapping is controller-specific and must not be
generalized to another AMDI0060 system without hardware evidence.

The module match tables cover exactly the two contracts above (`MSHW0231`,
`MSHW0162`); per-device tuning (grid geometry, CapImg sample count, baseline
frames) is selected by ACPI ID at probe time. Do not install this DKMS
package on another Surface, another AMD SPI controller, or a generic
`PNP0C51` device. The installer verifies the required ACPI IDs; an explicit
`--force` is required to bypass that check.

## Profiles

| Profile | `raw_mode` | Intended use | Release status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Standard | `N` | HID transport and descriptor discovery; single-touch installer default | Default for the planned controlled release |
| Raw | `Y` | MSHW0231 / MSHW0162 CapImg capture and beta multitouch pipeline | Experimental; requires `sl4a-touch.sh install --raw` |
| Standard-transport beta bridge | `N` | SET5-only transition into CapImg while retaining standard HID discovery/transport; publishes the beta MT node with `raw_input_beta=Y std_raw_transition=3` | Experimental/manual only; targeted SL4 AMD tracker/cold-boot evidence, not installer default or release-qualified |

The module's compiled default and the installer default are standard mode.
`sl4a-touch.sh install --raw` is required to write the packaged experimental
raw-mode profile. The standard-transport beta bridge used during targeted
qualification is intentionally not written by the installer.

`raw_input_beta` controls publication of the decoded multitouch input device.
Raw/CapImg operation alone does not establish release-quality contact behavior.

## Feature Status

| Feature | Status | Release claim |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Module build and host protocol tests | Automated | Yes, for listed host tests only |
| HID descriptor discovery | Implemented | Hardware matrix required |
| Standard HID report forwarding | Implemented | Contact behavior requires hardware evidence |
| Raw CapImg capture | Captures recorded | Experimental |
| Raw multitouch pipeline | Implemented | Experimental |
| Suspend/resume | Implemented | Hardware matrix required |
| Secure Boot | DKMS guidance only | Untested until recorded |

See `COMPATIBILITY.md` for release-qualified hardware results and `TESTING.md`
for the procedure required to add one.

## Explicitly Unsupported

- Surface Pro X and any other `MSHW*` device (other than MSHW0231/MSHW0162).
- Other AMD SPI controller IDs, including `AMDI0061` and `AMDI0062`.
- Firmware, kernel, or distribution combinations not listed in
  `COMPATIBILITY.md`.
- Any claim that Feature ID 5 alone is a portable or release-qualified raw
  activation method. SET5-only produced CapImg traffic on the targeted SL4 AMD
  candidate and survived a corrected-profile cold boot, but the broader
  lifecycle/hardware matrix remains incomplete.
