 * the SPB bus while it brings the touch controller up. The reference is the
 * SPB trace captures/wintrace/surface_init.csv from TXN 634377432 onwards,
 * whose write frames are, in order:
 *
 *   SET_POWER D0      02 00 00 04 82 00 00 04 00 01 01 0C EE 5B
 *   SET_FEATURE 0x56  02 00 00 03 C2 00 03 0A 00 56 BD 0C EE 5B 44 4C 00 00

 *   DESCREQ reg 2     02 00 00 02 42 00 00 03 00 00

 *
 * Two properties are load-bearing and are asserted byte for byte by
 * tests/wire_frames_test.c:
 *
 *   - the write opcode appears exactly once, as the first byte. The driver
 *     historically sent it twice (02 02 ...), which is not what the device is
 *     given by Windows.
 *   - the short command bodies (payloads of one or two bytes) are padded with
 *     the constant 0C EE 5B field, not with zeros. The same three bytes appear
 *     on every frame that carries a trailer, so they are a fixed
 *     key/check field, not data.
 *
 * The legacy doubled-opcode form is still emitted when the module parameter
 * wire_double_opcode=1, so both forms live side by side here and every caller
 * picks one through the wire_double_opcode value it passes in.
