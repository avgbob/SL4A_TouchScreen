 * Neighborhood radius for local-maximum suppression in
 * raw_detect_peaks(): a touched cell is a "peak" only if no other
 * touched cell within this Chebyshev radius has strictly higher
 * signal. Must comfortably cover a real finger blob's full extent, so
 * every non-center cell of the blob has its true (higher-signal)
 * center inside its own search window and gets correctly rejected.
 * Grid is 72 cols over ~292mm (~4.1mm/cell); a fingertip contact is
 * ~8-12mm, i.e. roughly a 2-cell radius from center to edge.
 *
 * An earlier version of this check compared only 4 fixed points at
 * exactly this distance (one cross-shaped probe per axis) instead of
 * scanning the whole neighborhood. That cannot reject a smoothly
 * tapering blob's non-center cells: a real finger blob has several
 * concentric rings of decreasing signal, so a probe at one exact
 * distance almost always lands either outside the blob (untouched,
 * trivially passes) or on a same-signal ring cell (not *strictly*
 * greater, so also passes) — every touched cell of the blob ends up
 * independently qualifying as a "peak". Found by a synthetic-frame
 * replay harness (tests/raw_pipeline_replay_test.c): ~13 spurious
 * peaks per blob exhausted the shared HEATMAP_MAX_PEAKS budget after
 * ~1-2 blobs, silently dropping any 3rd+ simultaneous touch before
 * CCL's velocity-rejection check ever saw it. The full-neighborhood
 * scan fixes this because the blob's true center — strictly higher
 * signal than every other cell in the blob — always falls within
 * radius of any of its own cells, correctly leaving only the center
 * as a peak regardless of taper shape. Flat-topped (plateau) regions
 * have no unique center; the raster-order tie-break in the scan makes
 * a plateau contribute exactly one peak, re-anchored to the cell nearest
 * the centre of its equal-signal region (a raster-first corner cell left
 * a wide saturated plateau's only peak outside the centroid's velocity-
 * rejection radius and dropped the whole contact) instead of
 * one per border cell.
 * Verified via replay to
 * correctly detect 1-5 simultaneous synthetic blobs; the exact
 * optimal radius may still benefit from real multi-finger hardware
 * confirmation.

 *     rate (10-frame skew passes, 12-frame skew does not). The measured

 *   - 3 cells sits above observed duplicate candidates (~1.72-2.00 cells)
