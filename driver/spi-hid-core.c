 * b1f8109 (v1.6.3) is the last build this panel answered on in RAW: the
 * 2026-09-15 field bundle shows the descriptors received 19x, data=6073 and 26
 * resets, and the 2026-09-17 battery's single positive was wire_double_opcode=1
 * alone delivering a DEVICE_DESC where the other 13 variants stayed at +0.
 * The complete dialect, reconstructed from the H1/H4 double-blind findings
 * (file:line @ b1f8109), is five points:
 *
 *   1. Doubled opcode on every write. b1f8109's sequencer frame tables carry
 *      the opcode twice — seq_descreq / vendor_init_cmd / sf_cmd / gf_cmd /
 *      vd2 / vd0 all begin `02 02 ..` — which is exactly the
 *      wire_double_opcode=1 form today (default OFF). Its spi_hid_output()
 *      transport also prepended 0x02 ("the observed Linux workaround"), but
 *      that function is dead in b1f8109: the doubling that reached the wire
 *      lives in those frame tables, not in the transport.
 *   2. Pre-DONE reads go to desc.input_register (0 until a descriptor parses)
 *      — no three-phase {3, 0x0A} selector, no probe-time 0x0A force.
 *      spi_hid_seq_read() @b1f8109 read the plain input_register. Today behind
 *      raw_pre_desc_reg0 (default OFF).
 *   3. Poller RESET_RSP gives up to the hardcoded fallback —
 *      spi_hid_seq_descreq_work type==3 @b1f8109:1513-24 (DONE/FALLBACK, ready,
 *      fallback descriptor). Today behind raw_fallback_on_reset (default OFF;
 *      the default retries forever).
 *   4. spi_hid_vendor_init = D2/D0 only, NO STOP frame (@b1f8109:640-658; the
 *      STOP frame entered later with 6bb72a6).
 *   5. Legacy 5-byte read frames — the current default; no change needed.
 *
 * When set AND raw_mode_active, the effective behavior of (1)(2)(3) is ON
 * regardless of their own knob values, implemented as an explicit OR at each
 * consumption site — spi_hid_wire_doubled()/spi_hid_wire_doubled_setfeat() for
 * the doubled flag, the two read destinations in spi_hid_seq_read() and
 * spi_hid_probe(), and the poller RESET_RSP branch — NEVER by overwriting those
 * globals in probe. Default 0: byte-for-byte the parent at every site. This
 * is the "restore the working dialect" switch for the 2026-09-17 regression. */

 * measured the DEVICE'S STATE, not the correct frame: the device was still
 * streaming from an earlier enable, and a device that is answered but not
 * addressed hands over its default content.
 *
 * The five-byte form cannot carry a content type (offset 6) or a content id
 * (offset 9), so a descriptor read and a feature read go out byte-identical
 * (`0B 00 00 03 FF`) and the device cannot tell them apart — found
 * independently by two review legs, and it is exactly what the header comment
 * on the builder says: a five-byte frame "is a request for register 0 —
 * answered with RESET_RSP, never with the descriptor".
 *
 * The field then settled the default, twice and against my own prediction. The
 * prediction was that the stop frame would wake the reference shape up: it did
 * not. With the stop in place, with the detector fixed, with everything this
 * file now does, the sweep of 2026-09-16 19:11 shows variant 0 silent on this
 * panel and variant 1 reaching DONE with `ready` set — its reset count down
 * from 47 to 4, so the storm is gone either way.
 *
 * So: the reference is the authority on the SEQUENCE — what is sent, in what
 * order, and why — and this panel is the authority on the ENCODING of each
 * frame, and it says five bytes with the register in the address field. That
 * is doctrine, not preference: the same sentence already appears in the
 * protocol notes for the transport offsets.
 *
 * What this default does NOT fix, stated here so it cannot be forgotten: the
 * five-byte form cannot name the content, which is why the device answers this
 * driver with resets and why device_desc stays 0 — the descriptor handshake is
 * still unreachable, and the driver reaches DONE through the hardcoded
 * fallback. That is the open problem, not a consequence of this line. */
